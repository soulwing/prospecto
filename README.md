Prospecto is a framework for producing textual representations of the 
information in the domain model of a Java application, that can be exchanged
with other systems via a RESTful web services API, or asynchronously using
JMS or Websocket. 

Using Prospecto, you write view templates in Java using a fluent builder API to 
describe the model objects and properties to include in a view. You can then use 
your templates to generate views which Prospecto can easily transform into JSON, 
XML, and practically any other structured representation format. ASN.1 anyone?

In addition to supporting the generation of views to produce a textual 
representation of your domain model, Prospecto can also apply the information in 
a textual representation of your model to create or update domain model instances. 
In other words, you can use Prospecto to facilitate "editing" of your domain 
model instances, as well as creating new model instances.

As of Propsecto version 2, the library requires a Java 8+ compiler and runtime
environment.

Demo
----

An easy way to learn what Prospecto can do is to look at a demo.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository into some convenient location.
2. Install the stupidly simple RESTful client [rc](https://github.com/soulwing/rc) 
   which you'll use to interact with the web service in the demo.

### Running the Demo

Open a shell and make the base `prosepecto` folder the shell's current 
folder.  Then run these commands.

```
mvn clean install
mvn wildfly:run
```

This will build Prospecto and will run it's JAX-RS demo module 
`prospecto-demo-jaxrs` in a Wildfly container. After the demo is running you
can use `rc` to access its resources.

```
rc get /prospecto-demo/api
```

This should produce some JSON.

If you look carefully at the data returned by `rc` you'll see that it 
contains some `href` elements for other resources. For example, 
`/prospecto-demo/api/leagues` and `/prospecto-demo/api/contacts`. Any time
you see an `href` element in a response from the demo, you can use the 
absolute path it specifies to interact with another demo resource.  
For example:

```
rc get /prospecto-demo/api/leagues
```

Prospecto has built-in support for producing views using JSON or XML. You can
ask for XML instead of JSON as follows.

```
rc -xml get /prospecto-demo/api/leagues
```

### Understanding the Demo

Investigate the source code for the demo at  `prospecto-demo-jaxrs/src/main/java`.

Start in the `domain` package. You'll see a domain model for representing 
softball or baseball leagues, with JPA annotations for persistence. See the
[UML diagram] (prospecto-demo-jaxrs/doc/domain-model.pdf) of the 
major components to get acquainted with the model. 

The `startup` package contains a bean that loads some demo data into the 
database when the application starts.

In the `service` package you'll find a `LeagueService` and a
`DivisionService` that are used to access some of the entities in the domain
model. Notice that the return values for the methods on the service are of type
`View`.  You also see a `UserContextService` in this package. We'll get to that 
later.

Before we look at how the service interfaces are implemented, take a look in
the `views` package. There are several interfaces with `...Views` as a naming
pattern. These interfaces define _view templates_. If you look at them carefully,
and compare them to the domain model types, you'll probably have a pretty good
idea of what they do. Each view template can be used to produce a `View`
from some model data. Some templates are referenced in other templates; 
templates can be composed to promote use and stay DRY. 

Now let's see how a template is used in `LeagueServiceBean`.  In each
of the methods in this bean, we use an entity manager to load some entities 
from the database. We then use a view template to generate a `View` instance
that contains the information in the retrieved entities. The template is used
to extract the various properties from the model data and put it into a form
that an be easily rendered as JSON, XML, YAML, or practically any other 
structured textual representation.  You'll see a similar implementation in
`DivisionServiceBean`.

When we generate a view from a template, we provide a _view context_. The
context object provides access to a powerful API that can be used to instrument
and/or manipulate the view generation process. You can use it to implement
features such as filtering, data type conversion, and other transformations.
In the demo the view context comes from a `ViewContextProducerBean`; a CDI
bean that produces a `ViewContext` and injects it wherever it is needed. The
demo bean shows just a few of the things you can do with view context.

As you can see from the fact that the demo templates are defined as interface
constants, a template is completely static and immutable after it is created.
This makes view templates fully thread safe, so they can be used safely 
in application-scoped service beans.

When a view is generated, the model content for the view is extracted from the
model object instances (usually entity types) and put into a format that 
facilitates producing a textual representation. The extraction happens 
immediately. So by generating our views inside of service tier, it happens in
the context of JPA entity manager, avoiding any potential for lazy loading
exceptions when the view is ultimately transformed into a textual 
representation.
